## This Fork

This fork adds an experimental option in the file menu that accepts a \*.binslot file and updates it with the checksum of the currently edited save file. This lets edited save files appear in the PC version of the game without having to edit the save slot file manually.

Some features of the save tool will break the save slot file (such as changing the main character's name), so it's recommended that users backup any save files before editing them or updating save slots.
